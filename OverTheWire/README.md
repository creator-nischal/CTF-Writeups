# OverTheWire – Bandit

This folder contains my write-up for the OverTheWire Bandit wargame.

Bandit was my first serious exposure to Linux, SSH, permissions, networking,
scripting, Git, and basic exploitation concepts.
Most levels forced me to slow down, read carefully, and actually understand
what was happening instead of just running random commands.

I’ve intentionally not included passwords.
The focus is on *how* each level is solved, not the final answer.

If you’re learning Linux or starting in cybersecurity, Bandit is gold.

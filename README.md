# CTF-Writeups
This repository contains my personal write-ups from various CTFs and wargames that I solve while learning cybersecurity.

I’m writing these mainly for myself — to remember how I approached problems, where I got stuck, and what finally made things click. 

If it helps someone else along the way, that’s a bonus.

This repo is not about dumping answers.

It’s about learning, thinking, and improving step by step.

I’ll keep adding more write-ups here as I continue solving new labs and challenges.
